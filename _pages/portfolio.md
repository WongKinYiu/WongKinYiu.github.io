DQGen
======
A question generation system, DQGen, is embedded into an intelligent tutoring system, called [Reading Tutor](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~listen/). Elementary school students in the America read a story on the system. Multiple-choice questions were inserted when reading in order to assess children reading comprehension. To evaluate a student's reading comprehension, it involves three cognitive processes - syntactic, semantic, intersential. DQGen can assess childrenâ€™s reading comprehension automatically. It generates three different distractors - ungrammatical, nonsensical, plausible. To test syntax, semantic and intersential process respectively. <br><br>
